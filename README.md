Hi there, thanks for looking. 


These are small python follow-along projects I did while learning python from various places

eggdrop.py:

You are supposed to catch eggs as they drop and keep score. If you miss three eggs, you run out of life and the gam eneds. It uses fun little things from tkinter like Canvas to draw and Tk to keep the game running.

This program was from Coding Projects in Python by DK
